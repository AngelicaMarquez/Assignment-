1.9 String Rotation
	I - Identify if s1 and s2 are subtring of each other. Substring having the meaning of one string having a rotation of the other.
	D - Boolean value. True if substring. False if NOT substring.
	E - 	"waterbottle", "erbottlewat" -> True
		"focus", "cusfo" -> True
		"lamp", "apml" -> False
		"abc", "a" -> Flase
		"cereal", "erealc" -> True
		For properties, both strings have to have the same length. I dentified the first character of the second string and search for equal values of strings.
		Patterns - repetition	
		waterbottle ----> wat--erbottlewat--erbottle Having the same string repited we can should find the second string.

	A - 	"book", "okbo" -> True
		It would return true if it keeps comparing for the next character.
	L- I learned about refleccion in words, keeping track of length and positions of characters.
