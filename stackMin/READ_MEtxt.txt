3.2 Stack Min
	I - Design a stack with push, pop, and min running in O(1)
	D - Stack
	E - To have a min function in the stack we can keep track of the minimum value when we insert a new element in the stack. So the push method will consist on
		checking if the size is zero then minimum is the element and I inserted into a node, with the value and the minimum value at that location.
		If the the size is not 0 the calculate the minimum from the x value and the minimum, the pudh other node.
		For return min just return the minimum value.
	A - If the minimum element of the stack is at the top, the at the moment to pop the minimum has to change. Not supported with my code.
	I - I reviewed the topics with stacks and how caan be used.
