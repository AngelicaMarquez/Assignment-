2.6 Palindrome
  I - Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome. Palindrome, a word that is the same from front to baack and back to front.
  D - Boolean value. True if palindrome. False if NOT palindrome.
  E - r->o->t->a->t->o->r    --> true
      a->b->b->a->   --> true
      p->a->p->e->r   --> false
      b->c->d->d->c->b -->true
      A data structure that can be used to solve the problem is stack with the property of first in, last out. A property of palindromes is its symetrical
      form. The first half of the word will reflect the second half. I populataed the stack half the length, then compared 
      the rest of the linked list poping the values from the stack.
  A -  k->a->y->a->k --> true
        a   --> true
       If the length is odd then ignore. If length is 1 return true.
  L - I learned the importance of thinking about data stuctures while solving the problems. Reviewd the properties of stacks.
